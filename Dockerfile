# Sons of the Forest dedicated server image for Flux.
#
# Written from scratch. Endnight ships the dedicated server for Windows only (Steam app 2465200,
# anonymous), so it runs under Wine on a virtual display, installed and updated with SteamCMD on
# every start, under a supervisor that writes dedicatedserver.cfg and ownerswhitelist.txt from the
# environment and the hub's panel, saves on stop, follows game updates, restarts daily if asked,
# keeps backups, and gives the hub a JSON status, the save slots, the owners and the settings.
# See README.md.
#
# The base. CI builds it pinned to the digest it resolved and records that digest in the
# org.opencontainers.image.base.digest label, which the scheduled check compares against
# (.github/ci/needs-rebuild.sh).

# Wine 10.0 staging-tkg from Kron4ek/Wine-Builds, the Wine our V Rising and Enshrouded images run:
# it has fsync and esync. Upstream Wine (WineHQ, Debian) sends every thread wait of a Windows
# server through wineserver; TKG builds from 10.16 on and WineHQ 11 are ntsync-only, which needs
# /dev/ntsync, a device Flux cannot pass into a container. The wow64 build is 64-bit only, like
# the server. PINNED by version AND checksum: moving Wine is a deliberate change, tested with a
# real server, never a side effect of a rebuild.
